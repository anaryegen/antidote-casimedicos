# Antidote CasiMedicos Datasets

In this project we present various datasets based on the CasiMedicos project, a community of medical professionals who collaboratively, 
voluntarily, and free of charge, publishes written explanations about the possible
answers included in the MIR exams. The aim is to generate a resource that
helps future medical doctors to study towards the MIR examinations. The original commented MIR exams, including the explanations, are published in the 
[CasiMedicos Project MIR 2.0 website](https://www.casimedicos.com/mir-2-0/).

The Resident Medical Intern exams, or MÃ©dico Interno Residente (MIR) in Spanish, are exams to assess medical
students' knowledge by means of a multiple-choice questionnaire sometimes contextualized by a short clinical case. Answering the MIR exam questions requires applying
evidence-based decision making and critical thinking according to the available evidence present in the case.
