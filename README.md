# Antidote CasiMedicos Datasets

In this repository we present various datasets based on the CasiMedicos project, a community of medical professionals who collaboratively, 
voluntarily, and free of charge, publishes written explanations about the possible
answers included in the Resident Medical Intern exams, or MÃ©dico Interno Residente (MIR) in Spanish. These exams aim to assess medical
students by means of a multiple-choice questionnaire sometimes contextualized by a short clinical case.

CasiMedicos Project MIR 2.0's objective is to generate a resource that
helps future medical doctors to study towards the MIR examinations. Thus, the original commented MIR exams, including the explanations, are published in the 
[CasiMedicos Project MIR 2.0 website](https://www.casimedicos.com/mir-2-0/).

Based on the original CasiMedicos data, we have generated three different variants of the Antidote CasiMedicos datasets.

+ casimedicos-exp
+ casimedicos-arg

These datasets have been developed within the [ANTIDOTE CHIST-ERA project](https://univ-cotedazur.eu/antidote).

## casimedicos-raw
After crawling, cleaning, and organizing the data, we obtained 1,561 com-
mented questions corresponding to the years 2011-2014, 2016, and 2018-2022.
Selecting those questions which included clinical cases reduced the number of
documents from 1,561 to 575.
